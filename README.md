# UD_Greek

## Description
The Greek UD Treebank is derived from the Greek
Dependency Treebank (http://gdt.ilsp.gr), a resource developed and maintained by researchers at the Institute for Language and Speech Processing/Athena R.C. (http://www.ilsp.gr).

This release was generated by automatically converting the original annotations. The conversion and harmonization to the UD schema is work in progress. The data in this release derive from primary texts that are in the public domain, including wikinews articles and european parliament sessions.

## Basic statistics

- Sentences:  2411
- Tokens:  59156
- Data split in train/dev/test sets: 1929/241/241 sentences

## Acknowledgments

We wish to thank all contributors to the original annotation efforts. A large part of those annotations was work by students of the postgraduate programme Technoglossia IV, organised by the Institute for Language and Speech Processing, the University of Athens and the National Technical University of Athens.
