# UD_Greek

## Description
The Greek UD Treebank is derived from the Greek
Dependency Treebank (http://gdt.ilsp.gr), a resource developed and maintained by researchers at the Institute for Language and Speech Processing/Athena R.C. (http://www.ilsp.gr).

This release was generated by automatically converting the original PDT-like annotations. The conversion and harmonization to the UD schema is work in progress. The data in this release derive from primary texts that are in the public domain.

## Data split
