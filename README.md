# UD_Greek

## Description
The Greek UD Treebank is derived from the Greek
Dependency Treebank (http://gdt.ilsp.gr) developed by researchers at the Institute
for Language and Speech Processing/Athena R.C. (http://www.ilsp.gr).

This first release of the resource was created by
automatic conversion of the original annotations. The conversion and harmonization to UD principles is work in progress. The data in this first release derive from primary texts that are in the public domain.


## Data split

Train/dev/test: 80/10/10 % randomly selected

## Basic statistics

- Sentences:  2411
- Tokens:  59156

## Acknowledgments

original annotation efforts.
A large part of the initial annotations were carried out by students of the postgraduate programme
Technoglossia IV, organised by the Institute for
Language and Speech Processing, the University
of Athens and the National Technical University of
Athens.
